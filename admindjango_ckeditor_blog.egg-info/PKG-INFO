        =====
        
        Blogs is a simple Django app to conduct Web-based Blogs. This Blog app
        allows authorized users to maintain a blog. Blogs are a series of posts
        that are time stamped and are typically viewed by date. Blog entries can
        be made depending on which roles have access to add blog.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "blog" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'blog',
                'ckeditor',
                'ckeditor_uploader',
            ]
        
        2. Add following lines to your settings.py:
        
            MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "uploads")
            MEDIA_URL = "/uploads/"
        
            CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_SLUGIFY_FILENAME = False
            CKEDITOR_JQUERY_URL = '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js'
            CKEDITOR_IMAGE_BACKEND = "pillow"
            CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_SLUGIFY_FILENAME = True
            CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = "uploads/"
        
            CKEDITOR_CONFIGS = {
            'default': {
                'skin': 'moono',
                'toolbar': 'full',
                'height': 100,
                'allowedContent': True,
            },
            }
            STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
            STATIC_URL = '/static/'
        
        3. Add following lines to end of url.py file
        
            urlpatterns += [
              url(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', serve, {
                  'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT,
              }),
            ]
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the blogs models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a blog (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/ to participate in the Blog.
