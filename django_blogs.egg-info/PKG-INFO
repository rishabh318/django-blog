        =====
        
        Blogs is a simple Django app to conduct Web-based Blogs. This Blog app
        allows authorized users to maintain a blog. Blogs are a series of posts
        that are time stamped and are typically viewed by date. Blog entries can
        be made depending on which roles have access to add blog.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'blog',
            ]
        
        2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls')),
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/ to participate in the poll.
